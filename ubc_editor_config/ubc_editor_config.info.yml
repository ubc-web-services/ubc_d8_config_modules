description: This module has been deprecated and replaced by <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/distributions_recipes">Drupal Recipes</a>. Before removing entirely, you will need to edit your active config and remove it from the `enforced` key of the `filter.format.filtered_text.yml` configuration file and any other instances you find. Once that has been done, it can be safely removed.
